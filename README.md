## Project Overview

This project consists of three main components:

- **Client**: A React Native mobile application that provides an intuitive user interface for live telemetry display, control commands, and data visualization.
- **Server**: Backend service responsible for data aggregation, command routing, and communication between the client and flight controller.
- **Flight Controller**: Embedded software managing the rocket’s onboard systems, sensor data acquisition, and executing control commands.
